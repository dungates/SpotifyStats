# Working on Spotify Data in Python and R
- I have approached this project as a method to learn python by replicating what I do in R as I have much more expertise coding in R.
- There are many different things going on in this folder, but the ultimate goal is to create a recommendation algorithm far better than Spotify's
- Sentiment analysis of multiple musicians as well as an R project to merge spotify and genius data allowing for easy obtainment of lyrics in R
